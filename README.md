# ClipChat - Llama 4 Multi-Modal Chrome Extension

**Chrome extension with Llama 4 multi-modal AI via Groq's fast inference. Chat with AI and analyze webpages directly in your browser.**

## Overview
This Chrome extension demonstrates multi-modal AI chat capabilities using Groq API for ultra-fast inference with Llama 4 models, built as a complete template that you can fork, customize, and deploy as your own Chrome extension.

The extension opens as a chat interface in Chrome's side panel, but its true power lies in its **vision capabilities** - users can select any region of a webpage or capture full-page screenshots, then ask Llama 4 questions about the visual content, from analyzing UI designs to extracting data from charts and diagrams.

**Key Features:**
- Multi-Modal AI powered by Llama 4 Maverick and Scout models for text and image understanding
- **Visual Analysis**: Select regions or capture full-page screenshots for AI-powered image analysis
- **Contextual Chat**: Ask questions about visual content with full context awareness
- Sub-second response times with Groq Fast AI Inference acceleration

## Security Notes

- **Minimal Permissions**: Only request permissions that are absolutely necessary
- **Static Asset Validation**: Ensure all static assets (icons, scripts) are valid and trusted
